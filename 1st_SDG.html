    <h1 style="color:rgb(223, 36, 36);font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORM<br>EVERYWHERE</h1>
   <div style="padding-left:20px; background-color: red; width: 50%;height: 50%;">
    <p>
        Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest <br>challenges facing humanity. While the number of people living in <br>extreme poverty dropped by more than half between 1990 and 2015, <br>too many are still struggling for the most basic human needs.</p>

     <p>As of 2015, about 736 million people still lived on less than US$1.90 a <br>day; many lack food, clean drinking water and sanitation. Rapid growth <br>in countries such as China and India has lifted millions out of poverty,<br> but progress has been uneven. Women are more likely to be poor than <br>men becausethey have less paid work, education, and own less <br>property.</p>

<p>Progress has also been limited in other regions, such as South Asia<br> and sub-Saharan Africa, which account for 80 percent of those living in<br> extreme poverty. New threats brought on by climate change, conflict <br>and food insecurity, mean even more work is needed to bring people <br>out of poverty.</p>

<p>The SDGs are a bold commitment to finish what we started, and end<br> poverty in all forms and dimensions by 2030. This involves targeting<br> the most vulnerable, increasing basic resources and services, and <br>supporting communities affected by conflict and climate-related <br>disasters.</p>

   <h1>GOAL TARGET</h1> 
   <ul><p>
   <li style="font-size:20px" > By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living <br>in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions</li>
   <li style="font-size:20px">Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors,<br> and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable</li>
   <li style="font-size:20px">By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights<br> to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership<br> and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology <br>and financial services, including microfinance</li>
   <li style="font-size:20px">By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their <br>exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic,<br> social and environmental shocks and disasters</li>
   <li style="font-size:20px">Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced<br> development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means <br>for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to<br> end poverty in all its dimensions</li>
   <li style="font-size:20px">Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro-poor<br> and gender-sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment<br> in poverty eradication actions</li>
