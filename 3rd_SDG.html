    <P>
        We have made great progress against several leading causes of death and disease. Life expectancy has increased dramatically; infant and maternal mortality rates have declined, we’ve turned the tide on HIV and malaria deaths have halved.
    </P>
    <p>
        Good health is essential to sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda reflects the complexity and interconnectedness of the two. It takes into account widening economic and social inequalities, rapid urbanization, threats to the climate and the environment, the continuing burden of HIV and other infectious diseases, and emerging challenges such as noncommunicable diseases. Universal health coverage will be integral to achieving SDG 3, ending poverty and reducing inequalities. Emerging global health priorities not explicitly included in the SDGs, including antimicrobial resistance, also demand action.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the world is off-track to achieve the health-related SDGs. Progress has been uneven, both between and within countries. There’s a 31-year gap between the countries with the shortest and longest life expectancies. And while some countries have made impressive gains, national averages hide that many are being left behind. Multisectoral, rights-based and gender-sensitive approaches are essential to address inequalities and to build good health for all.

   <h1>GOAL TARGET</h1> 
   <ul>
    <p>
   <li style="font-size:20px" > By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and<br> wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women<br> and older persons</li>
   <li style="font-size:20px">By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples,<br> family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources<br> and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment/li>
   <li style="font-size:20px">By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and <br>production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, <br>drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality</li>
   <li style="font-size:20px">By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species,<br> including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international <br>levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional <br>knowledge, as internationally agreed</li>
   <li style="font-size:20px">Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension <br>services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity<br> in developing countries, in particular least developed countries</li>
   <li style="font-size:20px">Correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all<br> forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect, in accordance with the mandate of <br>the Doha Development Round</li>
   <li style="font-size:20px">Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market <br>information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility.</li>
