     <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" ;> This week, half way into the Global Goals era, world leaders are gathering in New<br> York for the UN General Assembly. They will be reflecting on progress so far.</p>

<h1>HISTORY OF SDG's</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;" >

    The origin and history of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are rooted in a series of international conferences and agreements that aimed to address global challenges and promote sustainable development. The precursor to the SDGs was the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), established in the year 2000. The MDGs were a set of eight global development targets focused primarily on addressing poverty and related issues by 2015.<br>

    Here's a timeline of key events leading to the development of the SDGs:<br>

 <strong>1.</strong>  1987 - Brundtland Report: The World Commission on Environment and Development, led by Gro Harlem Brundtland, released the "Our Common Future" report, which introduced the concept of sustainable development and highlighted the need to balance economic growth, social development, and environmental protection.<br>
  
  <strong>2.</strong> 1992 - Earth Summit (Rio de Janeiro): The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) was held, leading to the adoption of the Agenda 21, a comprehensive plan of action to achieve sustainable development globally. This conference also led to the creation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).<br>
  
  <strong>3.</strong> 2000 - Millennium Summit: The United Nations Millennium Declaration was adopted, setting forth the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), a set of eight goals aimed at reducing poverty, hunger, disease, and gender inequality by 2015.<br>

  <strong>4.</strong> 2012 - Rio+20 (Rio de Janeiro): The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development marked the 20th anniversary of the 1992 Earth Summit. During this conference, world leaders recognized the need for a new set of goals to address a broader range of sustainable development issues beyond the MDGs.<br>
  
  <strong>5.</strong> 2013 - Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals (OWG): The United Nations established an Open Working Group with representatives from various countries to draft a proposal for a set of post-2015 sustainable development goals. This group identified 17 goals and 169 targets.<br>
  
  <strong>6.</strong> 2015 - Adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals: In September 2015, world leaders gathered at the United Nations Headquarters in New York to adopt the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The agenda includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 associated targets, known as the SDGs or Global Goals.<br>
  
 <strong>7.</strong> 2016 - Implementation Begins: The implementation of the SDGs officially began in January 2016. Governments, civil society organizations, businesses, and individuals around the world started working to achieve the goals and targets outlined in the 2030 Agenda.<br>
  
  <strong>Ongoing</strong> - Monitoring and Review: Regular monitoring and review mechanisms have been established to track progress towards achieving the SDGs. The United Nations High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) plays a central role in assessing progress, sharing best practices, and addressing challenges.<br>
  
  The SDGs provide a comprehensive framework for addressing a wide range of interconnected global challenges, including poverty, inequality, environmental degradation, and more. Unlike the MDGs, which focused mainly on developing countries, the SDGs are universal and apply to all countries, emphasizing the shared responsibility of the international community to create a more sustainable and equitable world by 2030.<br>
