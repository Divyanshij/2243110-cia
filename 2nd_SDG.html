    <h1 style="color:rgb(204, 170, 60);font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">ZERO HUNGER</h1>

    <P>
        The number of undernourished people has dropped by almost half in<br> the past two decades because of rapid economic growth and<br> increased agricultural productivity. Many developing countries that <br>used to suffer from famine and hunger can now meet their nutritional <br>needs. Central and East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean have<br> all made huge progress in eradicating extreme hunger.
    </P>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a huge barrier<br> to development in many countries. There are 821 million people <br>estimated to be chronically undernourished as of 2017, often as a<br> direct consequence of environmental degradation, drought and <br>biodiversity loss. Over 90 million children under five are dangerously <br>underweight. Undernourishment and severe food insecurity appear to<br> be increasing in almost all regions of Africa, as well as in South<br> America.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SDGs aim to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030, <br>making sure all people–especially children–have sufficient and<br> nutritious food all year. This involves promoting sustainable <br>agricultural, supporting small-scale farmers and equal access to land, <br>technology and markets. It also requires international cooperation to<br> ensure investment in infrastructure and technology to improve <br>agricultural productivity.
